## Overview

The challenge was to build an NFT preview card component with the resource provided. A simple card as it we see but lots of new things learned, new techniques learned and implemented. At first, thought to complete it in less time but ended up spending more time. It's good to learn to analyse the time may take for a particular project, that skill may save us a lot in many cases.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
- made semantic HTML structure
- started with Mobile-first workflow
- Used flexbox to display page in full height and center the element

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

As a beginner in front-end development, new design techniques found in this challenge was a plus that helped me learn the possibilities of diverse designs. Lots of challenges while designing helped me improve my skill on rectifying it and many things made me get used to the way we design. The following new things noticed learned while in this challenge.    
- hide an element visually
- adding an element and designing it after an element while hovering (understood using pseudo-element ::after and ::before on some browser doesn't work)
- Changing the color of an hr element.

### Continued development

Planning to learn more things that may ease or fuel development and its speed.
- CSS methodologies
- prettier
- Sass or Less
- SEO Basics
- Git
